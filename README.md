# twitch-chat-filter
This is a firefox extension that monitors twitch chat and hides messages that meet certain criteria such as:
-having fewer than 4 unique words  

-being fully uppercase  

-containing repeated substrings of length 4 or more characters  

-repeated sequences of 3 or more words.  
  
  

It does this by checking each new message element.
